	  <p>A <a href="https://www.cityofirvine.org/news-media/news-article/irvine-retains-safest-city-status">City of Irvine
post</a>
from last September touts Irvine&#8217;s retention of &#8220;Safest City&#8221;&nbsp;status:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The information released today shows that Irvine has the lowest rate
of violent crime of any City in the nation with a population of
250,000 or more. This is the 12th consecutive year Irvine has earned
the Safest City&nbsp;designation.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">FBI</span>â€™s Annual Uniform Crime Report measures Part 1 crime, which
includes murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary,
larceny-theft, auto theft and&nbsp;arson.</p>

	  <p>My own is the telegraph of another&#8217;s<br>
will, the living text of foreign desire,<br>
copying news only ever copied<br>
imperfectly, original to no&nbsp;one,</p>
<p>but given again a palled night long past.<br>
I am suspicious of the thing. It works<br>
in me, not by request, my ruling rhythm<br>
always to a beat I can&#8217;t&nbsp;subdue.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t stop it, I can&#8217;t make it louder,<br>
can&#8217;t teach it to love you if it won&#8217;t &mdash;<br>
this pulsing mass, unwanted Quasimodo<br>
abandoned on the doorsteps of&nbsp;ourselves.</p>
<p>Let it die. What&#8217;s shared in our silences<br>
can be refined in our figuring &mdash; try<br>
any new star, for example: traces<br>
of dust in space, intending of&nbsp;themselves</p>
<p>to be apart, find in their shared disdain<br>
a trust, and, pressing close, begin to burn.<br>
We&#8217;re born of what is made within this rending.<br>
It isn&#8217;t love that is&nbsp;unending.</p>

	  <h1>Two-Wolf&nbsp;Variations</h1>
	  <h6>01 June 2013</h6>

	<section>
	  <p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>A fight is raging inside me,&#8221; said an old man to his son. &#8220;It is a
terrible fight between two wolves. One wolf is darkness, rage,
grief. The other is good: compassion, peace, and love. The same fight
is going on inside&nbsp;you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The son considered this carefully for a moment and then asked, &#8220;Which
wolf will&nbsp;win?&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man replied simply, &#8220;The one you&nbsp;feed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The son thought this over again and, recalling some things he&#8217;d
learned in his health class recently, he said to his father, &#8220;What
if I feed the evil wolf a gluten-free diet of organically raised,
garden-green produce and sustainably farmed white-protein sources,
and the good wolf a more mainstream diet of fatty red proteins and
<span class="caps">GMO</span>-based corn products, maybe some occasional fast-food&nbsp;runs?&#8221;</p>
<p>But the old man had fallen&nbsp;asleep.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I would seriously kill for some McD&#8217;s,&#8221; the boy thought. He watched the old
man sleep for a minute, regarding him fondly. Then he yoinked a five-spot from
the old man&#8217;s wallet and stole into the&nbsp;night.  </p>
<hr/>

<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>A fight is going on inside me,&#8221; said an old man to his son. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
terrible fight involving three wolves. One wolf is darkness, rage,
grief. Another is good, compassion, peace. The third wolf sits at a
distance, observing the battle and refusing to judge either one. The
same wolves are within&nbsp;you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The son considered this carefully for a minute and then said, &#8220;Okay &mdash; 
so the third wolf neither wins nor loses? He just judges and stumbles
around in his&nbsp;boxers?&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; the old man said, &#8220;but if he does, he doesn&#8217;t give a&nbsp;fuck.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Right,&#8221; the son continued, &#8220;so, you&#8217;re, what? The third&nbsp;wolf?&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I never said any damned thing about&nbsp;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I think I get&nbsp;it.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Fuck you,&#8221; the old man said. &#8220;You don&#8217;t get&nbsp;shit.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I get that you&#8217;re never sober,&#8221; the son shot back, and the old man
whirled, squared off, paws bunched into white fists. He hesitated&nbsp;&mdash; </p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span><span class="caps">WHAT</span>?&#8221; the son yelled. &#8220;You don&#8217;t have <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">GUTS</span>? <span class="caps">TRY</span> <span class="caps">IT</span>!&#8221;</p>
<p>The father seethed: &#8220;Go find your mother and ask her if I had the guts
twenty years ago! <span class="caps">ASK</span> <span class="caps">HER</span>!&#8221; Then the old man winced and beat his
chest, and the boy, nearly in tears even though he&#8217;d seen this a
hundred times before, stormed away, wondering when he&#8217;d get his chance
for one shot, just one fair shot at that used-up son of a&nbsp;bitch.</p>
<hr/>

<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>A fight is going on inside me,&#8221; said an old man to his son. &#8220;It is a
terrible fight involving two wolves. One wolf is your Aunt Imelda&#8217;s
spicy tuna-broccoli casserole, and the other wolf is your Uncle Jeff&#8217;s
incessant bullshit about the &#8216;problems with this&nbsp;country.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>The son wasn&#8217;t sure about what to say, but the old man kept staring
at him with what might have been a tinge of annoyance, even anger,
though the boy couldn&#8217;t guess at what. Finally, the son said,
&#8220;Which wolf is going to&nbsp;win?&#8221; </p>
<p>The old man shut his eyes and shook his head. &#8220;Your uncle&#8217;s stupidity
isn&#8217;t going away anytime soon, but I think that casserole is about to
herald its triumphant spiritual&nbsp;return.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that, the father let rip a loud &#8220;howl,&#8221; and then belched&nbsp;explosively.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Jesus, Dad!&#8221; the boy yelped and then scurried off while his father&nbsp;chuckled.</p>
<hr/>

<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>A fight is going on inside&nbsp;me.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Dad&nbsp;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>It&#8217;s awful, this fight&nbsp;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>&mdash; two wolves, Dad, I&nbsp;know.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>One wolf, the handsome wolf&nbsp;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Dad, I think Melissa might be&nbsp;pregnant.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man stopped. He massaged his eyes as though what he&#8217;d heard
might have harmed his vision. He then regarded his son with a mix of
loss and sadness. Maybe some envy. He said, &#8220;I guess we know which
wolf won, don&#8217;t&nbsp;we?&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>It could&#8217;ve been either wolf, Dad. They were united on the
Melissa&nbsp;question.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Right.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I&#8217;ve told Mom. She thinks Melissa should move in and we should take
the spare room until the baby&#8217;s&nbsp;born.&#8221;</p>
<p>The father said, &#8220;A fight is going on inside me&nbsp;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<hr/>

<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>So these two wolves &mdash;&#8221; said an old man, but his young son cut in: &#8220;I
love you,&nbsp;Dad!&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>No one ever wants my wisdom,&#8221; the old man barked. At that, his
much-younger wife, Lupe, walked in with a platter. She was
radiant. This was his third marriage, and after two prior, staggering
shots at bliss and a dozen years in a Twelve Step program, he thought
he&#8217;d finally gotten his shit together. The boy was their only&nbsp;child.</p>
<p>She said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got nachos! Has the game&nbsp;started?&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Dad was going to talk about his&nbsp;wolves.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Oh, good,&#8221; said Lupe, who&#8217;d met the old man when they&#8217;d both
volunteered during the last Democratic election and had found
themselves serendipitously stranded in an elevator one night while
canvassing an upscale apartment building. &#8220;Well, wolves love
nachos. Happy Father&#8217;s Day,&nbsp;honey.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Everyone knows wolves love nachos,&#8221; the old man growled. He sampled
one. Chipot-ol&eacute;! And she&#8217;d found his favorite queso Oaxaca. He felt
full. Whole. He wolfed them&nbsp;down.</p>

	  <p>In your own sweet way you improvise<br>
inside me from outside, with hands and fingers<br>
pressing on strings, lips pressing, shaping,<br>
playing my favorite things, valves clatter,<br>
making air a messenger that sings.<br>
I was yours then, I am now, tonight,<br>
in any La Ve Lee or Blue Note,<br>
you take me any way you want, slow, down,<br>
cut, in a minor key, or any two five<br>
one giant step cycle, roaring down Sunset<br>
up at dawn, hours since the last shot,<br>
an hour since the last fuck you but you&#8217;re<br>
still in my head and that&#8217;s the history<br>
you make in me, etched in dreams an endless<br>
solo break that has changed the way I&nbsp;everything.  </p>
