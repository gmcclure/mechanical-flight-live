    <p>In your own sweet way you improvise<br>
inside me from outside, with hands and fingers<br>
pressing on strings, lips pressing, shaping,<br>
playing my favorite things, valves clatter,<br>
making air a messenger that sings.<br>
I was yours then, I am now, tonight,<br>
in any La Ve Lee or Blue Note,<br>
you take me any way you want, slow, down,<br>
cut, in a minor key, or any two five<br>
one giant step cycle, roaring down Sunset<br>
up at dawn, hours since the last shot,<br>
an hour since the last fuck you but you&#8217;re<br>
still in my head and that&#8217;s the history<br>
you make in me, etched in dreams an endless<br>
solo break that has changed the way I&nbsp;everything.  </p>
