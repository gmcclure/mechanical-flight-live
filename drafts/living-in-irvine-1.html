    <p>A <a href="https://www.cityofirvine.org/news-media/news-article/irvine-retains-safest-city-status">City of Irvine
post</a>
from September 25, 2017, touts Irvine&#8217;s retention of &#8220;Safest City&#8221;&nbsp;status:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The information released today shows that Irvine has the lowest rate
of violent crime of any City in the nation with a population of
250,000 or more. This is the 12th consecutive year Irvine has earned
the Safest City&nbsp;designation.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">FBI</span>&#8217;s Annual Uniform Crime Report measures Part 1 crime, which
includes murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary,
larceny-theft, auto theft and&nbsp;arson.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As someone who&#8217;s been living here for eleven years &mdash; a
confession that dismays me as I write it &mdash; the post&#8217;s
capitalization of &#8220;City&#8221; in &#8220;any City in the nation&#8221; is nearly as
telling as the <span class="caps">FBI</span>&#8217;s roseate designation. It is to being a &#8220;City&#8221; that
Irvine originally aspired and has ultimately succeeded at becoming,
the capital C signifying the town&#8217;s reach for utopian&nbsp;distinction.</p>
