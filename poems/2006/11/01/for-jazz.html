          <p>In your own sweet way you improvise<br />
inside me from outside, with hands and fingers<br />
pressing on strings, lips pressing, shaping,<br />
playing my favorite things, valves clatter,<br />
making air a messenger that sings.<br />
I was yours then, I am now, tonight,<br />
in any La Ve Lee or Blue Note,<br />
you take me any way you want, slow, down,<br />
cut, in a minor key, or any two five<br />
one giant step cycle, roaring down Sunset<br />
up at dawn, hours since the last shot,<br />
an hour since the last fuck you but you’re<br />
still in my head and that’s the history<br />
you make in me, etched in dreams an endless<br />
solo break that has changed the way I everything.</p>
