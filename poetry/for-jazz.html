          <p>I ride, Night Train, down Lankershim,<br />
in black boots and leather, and<br />
shooting Knob Creek with riders<br />
telling history in pictures<br />
etched permanent on proven arms.<br />
But there is a history I keep of you,<br />
of what you’ve done to me in those dark rooms,<br />
with liquor in a glass, and liquid changes<br />
spilling out a front door, filling<br />
for a moment the street with your loud<br />
cut-time easy laugh that sounds, God<br />
exactly like her, exactly like another round,<br />
exactly like tonight –<br />
you know, whatever I want, or<br />
whatever you want.</p>

<p>In your own sweet way you improvise<br />
inside me from outside, with hands and fingers<br />
pressing on strings, lips pressing, shaping,<br />
playing my favorite things, valves clatter,<br />
making air a messenger that sings.<br />
I was yours then, I am now, tonight,<br />
in any La Ve Lee or Blue Note,<br />
you take me any way you want, slow, down,<br />
cut, in a minor key, or any two five<br />
one giant step cycle, roaring down Sunset<br />
up at dawn, hours since the last shot,<br />
an hour since the last fuck you but you’re<br />
still in my head and that’s the history<br />
you make in me, etched in dreams an endless<br />
solo break that has changed the way I everything.</p>
