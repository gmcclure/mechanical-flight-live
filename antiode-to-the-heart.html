    <p>My own is the telegraph of another&#8217;s<br>
will, the living text of foreign desire,<br>
copying news only ever copied<br>
imperfectly, original to no&nbsp;one,</p>
<p>but given again a palled night long past.<br>
I am suspicious of the thing. It works<br>
in me, not by request, my ruling rhythm<br>
always to a beat I can&#8217;t&nbsp;subdue.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t stop it, I can&#8217;t make it louder,<br>
can&#8217;t teach it to love you if it won&#8217;t &mdash;<br>
this pulsing mass, unwanted Quasimodo<br>
abandoned on the doorsteps of&nbsp;ourselves.</p>
<p>Let it die. What&#8217;s shared in our silences<br>
can be refined in our figuring &mdash; try<br>
any new star, for example: traces<br>
of dust in space, intending of&nbsp;themselves</p>
<p>to be apart, find in their shared disdain<br>
a trust, and, pressing close, begin to burn.<br>
We&#8217;re born of what is made within this rending.<br>
It isn&#8217;t love that is&nbsp;unending.</p>
